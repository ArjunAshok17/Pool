# Database Design #

## High-Level Overview ##
As a high-level overview, the strategy we have implemented rests on splitting
user data into two main databases: Firebase (for easy authentication and
sign-in) and MongoDB (for efficient, large storage purposes for all other
data).

The integration with Google means Firebase will be an easy option for
implementing not only user authentication, but unique user keys for use as a
primary key that links data from both databases.


## Database Schema ##
Below, we define the schema for both databases and the motivation behind this
layout.

### Firebase ###
lol gl yash

### MongoDB ###
gl yash pt 2


## Functionality Necessary ##
Here, we define the functionality we deem necessary in querying and operating
on each database. This is more for outlining the capabilities that any utility
programs we use for database ops have all the functionality necessary for
making the most of the schema defined.

### Firebase ###
lol

### MongoDB ###


## Conclusion ##
Data is cool. We like data.
