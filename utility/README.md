# Utility #
The utility folder will store:
 - Any C++ code that is imported into the algorithms programs we use
 - Any isolated functions that are defined in files for import into other
   scripts, algorithms, etc.
 - Any other code that is imported, but doesn't fall under scripts, algorithms,
   or web-app
