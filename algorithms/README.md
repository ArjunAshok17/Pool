# Algorithms #
The algorithms folder will store:
 - The finalized code for processing data to produce the results we want; this
   ranges from the clustering, driver-selection, finance-calculation, and any
   other formulas / procedures that need to be implemented.
 - Packaged code for engineering any data as necessary

All code in this directory must be organized and easily called for any routes,
etc. No code should be outside of a function. These are **not** scripts, these
should be packaged functions.
