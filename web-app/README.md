# Web-App #
The web-app folder will store:
 - All front-end code for rendering the final app
 - All back-end code for managing the users' data, calculating paths, and any
   other routes that should be accessed. This will use the functionality
   defined in the other directories
 - All library imports necessary for the web-app
